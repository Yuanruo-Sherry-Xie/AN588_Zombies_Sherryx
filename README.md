-   Hi there! üòÑ

-   In this repo you should see the following:

    -   Orignial code (r markdown)

    -   Original code (html)

    -   Final code based off of the original code \^ (r markdown) (STILL WORKING ON IT)

    -   Final code based off of the original code \^ (html) (STILL WORKING ON IT)

    -   Peer commentary from ‚Äì (r markdown)

    -   Peer commentary from ‚Äì (html)

-   My orignial code which incorporates all questions asked in the HW 3 file

-   Each section should be the title/ header before the notes and code are shown

-   I have comments in my code sections to help my readers and myself understand what's going on or my thought process in general, let me know if they are confusing

-   In my original code is also 5 struggles I encountered while doing homework 3

Thank you for reading this!üëç

### 5 Struggles I Have Encountered Doing HW 3

1.  **Communication with Group Members**: I had a hard time coordinating with my groupmates because they were unresponsive to my Slack messages and emails. This made it difficult to clarify questions and ensure we were all on the same page. One group member finally sent me her repository, but it was late Sunday night, leaving me little time to review her work or provide meaningful feedback. This last-minute sharing also made it harder to incorporate any potential revisions before the deadline.
2.  **Understanding Factors vs. Data Frames:** One of the biggest technical challenges I faced was knowing when to convert factors into numerical values for analysis. At times, I didn‚Äôt realize that a variable was stored as a factor, which led to errors when trying to perform calculations. Other times, I converted a factor into numbers but didn't check whether R had assigned meaningful numerical values or just default categorical codes. This made me second-guess how I was handling data and whether I was processing it correctly for statistical analysis.
3.  **Difficulty Finding Information from Previous Modules:** Since this assignment required integrating multiple concepts we‚Äôve covered in previous modules, I found myself constantly going back to old notes and materials. However, I wasted a lot of time searching for specific details because I didn‚Äôt have an organized way to reference them. I realized that I need to create a dedicated document that summarizes key functions, common troubleshooting solutions, and essential concepts from each module. Having a centralized resource would make reviewing past material much more efficient and help me work through assignments faster.
4.  **Increased Errors and Self-Doubt in Coding:** Compared to previous assignments, I found myself getting stuck much more frequently. Small errors, like typos or forgetting a specific function syntax, caused frustrating error messages that were difficult to debug on my own. Since this assignment involved statistical concepts on top of R coding, I struggled to piece together different elements correctly. The frequent setbacks made me doubt my ability to code effectively, and I found myself questioning whether I was really improving in R. The fact that stats build upon so many previous modules made troubleshooting even harder, as a mistake from an earlier step could throw off the entire analysis.
5.  **Time Management and Workflow Balance:** Last time, I decided to finish all the modules before starting the homework, thinking it would help me troubleshoot less on my own. However, this time, I spent so much time working through the modules that I didn‚Äôt leave myself enough time to complete the assignment properly. I felt rushed while finishing the homework and didn‚Äôt have enough time to double-check my work or debug issues carefully. I need to adjust my time allocation so that I can still review the modules while ensuring I have enough time to apply the concepts and complete the assignment at a
