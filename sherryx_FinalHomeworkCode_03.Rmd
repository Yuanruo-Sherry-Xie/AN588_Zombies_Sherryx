## Set up

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
#download the new package ggpubr first
#install.packages("ggpubr") for Q-Q plots

#install.packages("rmdformats") 

#loading ggplot for the figures
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(ggpubr)
library(rmdformats)
```

```{r}
#loading prettydoc for the theme

## Favorite picture related to zombies that I was able to find online (credit to reddit)

![](flat,750x,075,f-pad,750x1000,f8f8f8.u2.png){width="300"}

## Load zombie. csv

```{r}
#loading the initial zombie csv from prof. schimt's repo
zombie <- read.csv("/Users/sherryxie/CODE/Github/repos/Homework/Sherry's Homework 03/zombies.csv")

#trying to visually understanding the data before I do anything to it 
str(zombie)
```

## 1. Population mean and standard deviation ERROR

```{r}
# Function for population mean and standard deviation since we can not use build in sd and var
pop_v <- function(zombie) {
     sum((zombie - mean(zombie))^2)/(length(zombie))
 }
 pop_sd <- function(zombie) {
     sqrt(pop_v(zombie))
 }
 pop_sd(zombie$weight)

# Select relevant quantitative variables
quantitative_variables <- zombie %>% select(height, weight, age, zombies_killed, years_of_education)

# Apply the function to each quantitative column listed in hw instruction
# ERROR MESSAGE HERE
population_stats_results <- sapply(quantitative_variables, pop_sd)

print(population_stats_results)
```

## 2. Boxplot for each quantitative variable by gender

```{r}
# Convert gender to a factor just in case it is not already 
zombie$gender <- as.factor(zombie$gender)

# Boxplot for each quantitative variable by gender
ggplot(zombie, aes(x = gender, y = height)) + geom_boxplot() + theme_minimal()
ggplot(zombie, aes(x = gender, y = weight)) + geom_boxplot() + theme_minimal()
ggplot(zombie, aes(x = gender, y = age)) + geom_boxplot() + theme_minimal()
ggplot(zombie, aes(x = gender, y = zombies_killed)) + geom_boxplot() + theme_minimal()
ggplot(zombie, aes(x = gender, y = years_of_education)) + geom_boxplot() + theme_minimal()

```

## 3. Scatterplots of height and weight in relation to age

From the two plots, I think the two variables height and weight are related because the line of best fit from both scatter plots are linearly upward trend.

```{r}
#age vs height scatterplot
# I added in a line of best fit to better help me see if the two terms are related with each other 
ggplot(zombie, aes(x = age, y = height)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm") + theme_minimal()

#age vs weight scatterplot
# I added in a line of best fit to better help me see if the two terms are related with each other 
ggplot(zombie, aes(x = age, y = weight)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm") + theme_minimal()
```

## 4. Histograms and Q-Q plots

-   From the histogram and qqplot comparison below, height, weight, and age are drawn from the normal distribution

-   From the histogram and qqplot comparison below zombies killed and years of education are **NOT** drawn from the normal distribution

    -   I think specifically zombies killed and years of education are drawn from Poisson distribution because they are skewed to the left and their qqplot does not follow the linear diagonal line

```{r}
# Function to plot histogram & Q-Q plot so I do not have to write it out for each of the variables
normal_distribution_check <- function(variable, name) {
  par(mfrow = c(1, 2))  # Side-by-side plots histogram vs pplot comparision
  hist(variable, main = paste("Histogram of", name), col = "lightblue", probability = TRUE) #histogram view
  qqnorm(variable, main = paste("Q-Q Plot of", name)) #qqplot view
  qqline(variable, col = "red")                       #qqplot linear diagonal line
}

# Apply to each variable
normal_distribution_check(zombie$height, "Height")        #height comparision
normal_distribution_check(zombie$weight, "Weight")       #weight comparision
normal_distribution_check(zombie$age, "Age")             #age comparision
normal_distribution_check(zombie$zombies_killed, "Zombies Killed")       #zombies killed comparision
normal_distribution_check(zombie$years_of_education, "Years of Education")   #years of education comparision

```

## 5. Pt:1 Random Sample of 30 & Calculate Summary Statistics

```{r}
set.seed(100)  # For reproducibility

# Sample 30 survivors without replacement
sample_30 <- zombie %>% sample_n(30)

# Compute sample mean, sample SD, and standard error
#I used the built in version compared to question one because no we are looking at a sample
sample_stats <- sample_30 %>% summarise(
  Mean_Height = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE),
  SD_Height = sd(height, na.rm = TRUE),
  SE_Height = SD_Height / sqrt(30),

  Mean_Weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
  SD_Weight = sd(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
  SE_Weight = SD_Weight / sqrt(30),

  Mean_Age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE),
  SD_Age = sd(age, na.rm = TRUE),
  SE_Age = SD_Age / sqrt(30),

  Mean_ZombiesKilled = mean(zombies_killed, na.rm = TRUE),
  SD_ZombiesKilled = sd(zombies_killed, na.rm = TRUE),
  SE_ZombiesKilled = SD_ZombiesKilled / sqrt(30),

  Mean_Education = mean(years_of_education, na.rm = TRUE),
  SD_Education = sd(years_of_education, na.rm = TRUE),
  SE_Education = SD_Education / sqrt(30)
)

print(sample_stats)

```

## 5. Pt 2: 95% CI

```{r}
# Function to calculate 95% Confidence Interval
calc_CI <- function(mean, se, n) {
  error_margin <- qt(0.975, df = n - 1) * se
  lower <- mean - error_margin
  upper <- mean + error_margin
  return(c(lower, upper))  # Returns a vector of length 2
}

#Listing out the CI for all the variables
sample_stats <- sample_stats %>%
  mutate(
    CI_Height_Lower = Mean_Height - qt(0.975, df = 30-1) * SE_Height,
    CI_Height_Upper = Mean_Height + qt(0.975, df = 30-1) * SE_Height,
    CI_Weight_Lower = Mean_Weight - qt(0.975, df = 30-1) * SE_Weight,
    CI_Weight_Upper = Mean_Weight + qt(0.975, df = 30-1) * SE_Weight,
    CI_Age_Lower = Mean_Age - qt(0.975, df = 30-1) * SE_Age,
    CI_Age_Upper = Mean_Age + qt(0.975, df = 30-1) * SE_Age
  )

# Print results
print(sample_stats)

```

## 6. Pt 1: Generate 99 More Samples (Total 100) & Calculate Sampling Distribution

Comparison of standard deviation to standard error in part 5. The SD and SE for each of the variables still seem pretty similar, for example. SD for age = 0.47, SE for age = 0/495. There is no set of value that is suddenly drastically different from each other.

```{r}
set.seed(100) #set for reproducibility 

# Function to sample and compute means
sample_means <- function() {
  sample_100 <- zombie %>% sample_n(30)
  return(c(
    mean(sample_100$height, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean(sample_100$weight, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean(sample_100$age, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean(sample_100$zombies_killed, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean(sample_100$years_of_education, na.rm = TRUE)
  ))
}

# Repeat 99 times
sampling_99 <- replicate(99, sample_means())

# Convert to data frame
sampling_df <- as.data.frame(t(sampling_99))
colnames(sampling_df) <- c("Height", "Weight", "Age", "ZombiesKilled", "YearsEducation")

# Calculate mean & SD of sampling distribution
sampling_summary <- sampling_df %>% summarise_all(list(Mean = mean, SD = sd))
print(sampling_summary)

```

## 6. Pt:2 Normally distributed visualization

Now that is has been 100 samples, it seems like all the variables from the histogram visualization are all normally distributed. Even zombies killed and years of education that were originally not normally distributed.

```{r}
# Histograms for sampling distributions
ggplot(sampling_df, aes(x = Height)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, fill = "lightblue", color = "black") + theme_minimal()
ggplot(sampling_df, aes(x = Weight)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "lightblue", color = "black") + theme_minimal()
ggplot(sampling_df, aes(x = Age)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "lightblue", color = "black") + theme_minimal()
ggplot(sampling_df, aes(x = ZombiesKilled)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "lightblue", color = "black") + theme_minimal()
ggplot(sampling_df, aes(x = YearsEducation)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "lightblue", color = "black") + theme_minimal()
```
